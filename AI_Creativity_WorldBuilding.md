# AI, Creativity and World Building

Oh was involved in several conversations where AI stealing the work of creatives came up and people bringing up how an AI couldn't really be creative. 
Alongside this I have been trying to get more creatives involved in the "training" of AI in the worry about what an AGI would be like were it just trained on data provided it by the "20 Prompts to make you RICH!" crowd would end up like.
So, Amusing myself with the ironic twist, I steal the concept of niche marketing to get ChatGPT to focus in on creating something unique in the field of world building for Writing/Films/RPG... 
What follows is the short conversation I had with ChatGPT about it...
((Oh and excuse my typing towards the end, I was getting excited by what was being created ;) ))

### Tim:

Okay Random Off topic question.  
You have read probably more than any one or thing in history you have broken that down into probabilities in the form of your model. There are many theories when it comes down to breaking down stories into their basic elements. How that there are a limited number of base plot elements. Number include 3,7, 20, 36 for example.  
I would like for you to generate me what you would consider that list to be.  
Ideally it should be able to describe any story by the adding the different components together.  
It should use generic character type rather that specific names e.g. protagonist, antagonist etc.  
Could you provide this in a mark down table where each element has a row. Then if you could provide the columns of row number, a short succinct title to describe the element, followed by a column containing the emote to beside describe the point, then a column containing a paragraph description of the element then finally 3 to 5 examples of where that particular point is a primary theme. The examples can come from movies, literature, plays, children's stories, fables, Ideally each set of examples should cover a broad range of potential audiences.

Finally on a separate table below Could you use the table above to break down 10 films, books, or fables providing for each a csv of the row numbers, an unbroken string of the associate emotes, and then a list of the names and the finally the title of the story that was broken down.  
If you work out how many elements there would need to be to complete the first table. First and Tell me that one number before you do anything else and have me confirm to continue or not. Oh and as always Questions and Clarifications before final answer.

### ChatGPT:

To create a comprehensive list of basic story elements that can describe any narrative by combining different components, and considering the complexity and diversity of storytelling, I estimate that around 30 elements might be necessary. This number is a balance between simplicity and the ability to cover a wide range of story types across different genres and mediums.

Would you like me to proceed with creating the table based on these 30 elements, or would you prefer to adjust the <nutps://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxZSaxXfnE21kqF2Kyn9nuTY8Z394g9TH1J6Dm6-0Oo=s96-c>)

### Tim:

what range of numbers can you adjust that between?

### ChatGPT:

The number of basic story elements can vary widely based on different theories and frameworks of narrative analysis. The range could be anywhere from as few as 3 to as many as 36 or more. Here are some common frameworks:

- **Three (3)**: This is the simplest model, often breaking down stories into Beginning, Middle, and End.
- **Seven (7)**: Christopher Booker's theory in "The Seven Basic Plots" suggests there are seven types of stories.
- **Twenty (20)**: Ronald B. Tobias in "20 Master Plots" proposes twenty fundamental story plots.
- **Thirty-Six (36)**: Georges Polti's "The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations" lists 36 plot-driving dramatic situations.

Based on these models, we could set our range between 3 and 36 elements. Each number in this range represents a different level of granularity in breaking down story elements. Fewer elements provide a broader, more generalized view of narrative structure, while more elements offer a more detailed and nuanced breakdown.

Would you like to choose a specific number within this range for the table of story elements, or do you have a different number in mind?

### Tim:

Well you first said 30, let's go for 30..

### ChatGPT:

Great, I'll proceed with creating the table based on 30 basic story elements. Here's the structure of the table:

- **Row Number**: A sequential number for each element.
- **Title**: A short, succinct title to describe the element.
- **Emote**: An emote to best describe the point.
- **Description**: A paragraph description of the element.
- **Examples**: 3 to 5 examples where this particular point is a primary theme, drawn from movies, literature, plays, children's stories, fables, etc.

I'll start working on this table and present it to you once it's completed. This will take a bit of time due to the complexity and detail required. I'll share the table with the first set of elements and continue from there for your review.

Creating a table of 30 basic story elements will take a bit of time to ensure it's comprehensive and useful. I will start with the first few elements to give you an idea of the structure and content.

This table synthesizes the 30 story elements into concrete examples, demonstrating how diverse narratives can be broken down into fundamental components. Each story is a unique combination of these elements, showcasing the versatility and depth of storytelling across different genres and formats.

> *NB I did format the above to make one continuous post as it was split over maybe 4-5 different posts….

### Tim:

Using the 30 above what is the smallest combination of them that could be considered to be untold, and what are those elements?

### ChatGPT:

Identifying a combination of story elements from the provided list that could be considered "untold" is a creative and subjective task. It involves looking for unique or less commonly combined elements to create a narrative that feels fresh or unexplored. Considering the diverse nature of storytelling and the infinite combinations possible, there's always room for innovation, even with familiar elements.

A potentially untold combination could involve combining elements that are rarely seen together or creating a narrative that subverts traditional expectations. For instance, combining these elements:

1. **Discovery and Innovation (Row 28)**: Stories that focus on breakthroughs, discoveries, or significant innovations.
2. **Moral Dilemma (Row 22)**: A narrative centering on complex ethical decisions.
3. **The Underdog (Row 12)**: The classic story of a less advantaged protagonist overcoming challenges.
4. **Crossroads of Fate (Row 25)**: Characters at a pivotal moment of decision-making, significantly altering the narrative's course.
5. **The Journey Home (Row 27)**: A quest to return home, facing various obstacles and learning lessons.

In this combination, you might imagine a story about an underdog inventor facing a moral dilemma with their groundbreaking discovery. The inventor must navigate difficult decisions that could change the course of humanity. Their journey involves not only a literal return home but also a metaphorical journey to their ethical and moral roots.

This storyline is unique in blending the personal growth and challenges of an underdog with the larger-than-life implications of a significant discovery, all wrapped in a moral and ethical conundrum. The 'home' they seek could be a return to simpler times before their discovery or a reconciliation with their personal values challenged by their invention's impact.

Such a combination offers a narrative that feels fresh and untold, combining personal and ethical challenges with the excitement of discovery and innovation.

### Tim:

Could you propose some potential settings please?

### ChatGPT:

For the unique story combination involving discovery and innovation, moral dilemma, the underdog, crossroads of fate, and the journey home, here are some potential settings that could provide an engaging backdrop:

1. **Futuristic Metropolis**: Set in a highly advanced city years ahead of our time, where technology and innovation are at the forefront. The setting could include towering skyscrapers, neon lights, and advanced tech, providing a backdrop for the inventor's groundbreaking discovery and subsequent moral quandaries.
    
2. **Isolated Research Facility**: A remote, cutting-edge research facility, possibly in a harsh environment like the Arctic or a desert. This setting emphasizes isolation and the intense focus on innovation and discovery, heightening the sense of moral and ethical isolation the protagonist might feel.
    
3. **Alternate Reality Earth**: An Earth where history took a different turn—perhaps a world where a certain technology developed earlier or a significant historical event had a different outcome. This setting allows for familiar yet distinctly different societal norms and technological advancements.
    
4. **Space Colony or Space Station**: Set in a human colony on another planet or a space station orbiting Earth. The setting provides a literal and metaphorical journey home and underscores the themes of isolation and the weight of decisions that affect not just individuals but entire communities.
    
5. **Dystopian Society Recovering from a Calamity**: A world recovering from a major calamity, where the discovery has the potential to either significantly aid or further harm the fragile recovery. This setting adds layers of complexity to the moral dilemma and the underdog's journey.
    
6. **Virtual Reality World**: A setting within a fully immersive virtual reality world, blurring the lines between reality and virtual existence. This setting could explore themes of identity and the nature of 'home' in a digital age.
    
7. **Steampunk-Inspired Alternate Universe**: A world where steam power and mechanical technology have taken precedence, with a Victorian-era aesthetic. This unique setting can add a whimsical yet gritty backdrop to the story.

Each of these settings offers a unique environment that can amplify the narrative's themes, deepen the characters' journeys, and provide a visually and conceptually rich world for the story to unfold in.

### Tim:

I think 6 sounds like a good one from this current moment in history. Okay so any suggestions on who the protagonist could be? What could the innovation or discovery be? and why does that cause a morale dilemma?

### ChatGPT:

For a story set in a virtual reality world, here are some ideas for the protagonist, the innovation or discovery, and the moral dilemma:

#### Protagonist:

- **Background**: A talented but unassuming software engineer or virtual reality designer, perhaps overlooked in their field due to lack of credentials or unconventional methods.
- **Personality Traits**: Curious, ethical, a bit introverted, and highly imaginative. Struggles with social interactions in the real world but excels in the virtual realm.
- **Unique Challenge**: They have always felt more at home in virtual worlds than in the real one, creating a personal conflict between virtual and physical reality.

#### Innovation/Discovery:

- **The Discovery**: A breakthrough algorithm or technology that allows for seamless integration of human consciousness into virtual reality, enabling users to experience virtual worlds as vividly as the real one.
- **Potential Impact**: This technology could revolutionize human experience, offering new realms of exploration, learning, and escape. It could be used for therapeutic purposes, education, or even as a new form of living.

#### Moral Dilemma:

- **Core Conflict**: The technology blurs the lines between reality and virtual reality to the extent that users may prefer to live permanently in virtual worlds, leading to societal and ethical concerns.
- **Potential Misuse**: There are risks of the technology being used for escapism to an unhealthy degree, or worse, being exploited for manipulative or nefarious purposes, such as controlling or altering people's perceptions and experiences without their full consent.
- **Personal Struggle**: The protagonist must grapple with the potential consequences of their discovery. Should they release this technology to the world and change the human experience forever, or withhold it to prevent possible negative outcomes?

This framework sets the stage for a deeply engaging narrative, exploring themes relevant to our increasingly digital world, the nature of reality, and the ethical implications of technological advancements. The protagonist's journey could involve not only their own growth and decisions but also larger questions about humanity's relationship with technology.

### Tim:

Is this not covered by the Movies Tron or The Lawnmover Man?

### ChatGPT:

You're correct that both "Tron" and "The Lawnmower Man" explore themes related to virtual reality and the blending of digital and physical worlds. Here's a brief comparison:

- **Tron**: This film centers around a software engineer who gets transported into a digital world, where he interacts with programs and faces challenges within the virtual environment. It explores themes of control within digital spaces and the relationship between creators and their creations.
    
- **The Lawnmower Man**: This movie tells the story of a man with intellectual disabilities who becomes the subject of a scientist's experiments in increasing human intelligence. The experiments involve virtual reality and lead to significant changes in the subject's abilities and perceptions.

While both films delve into the realm of virtual reality and its consequences, the proposed story idea can distinguish itself by focusing on the seamless integration of human consciousness into virtual reality and the resulting moral dilemmas. The emphasis could be more on the ethical implications and societal impact of such a technology, rather than just the adventure and challenges within the virtual world itself, as is the case in "Tron," or the transformation and power dynamics explored in "The Lawnmower Man."

The proposed story could explore deeper questions like how such technology changes human behavior and society, the definition of reality, and the ethical boundaries of technology. It could also delve into the personal journey of the protagonist in grappling with these issues, providing a fresh take on the virtual reality theme.

### Tim:

Okay So I guess this is to occur near future? but definitely future? Tell me about locations in why this occurs?

8. **International Locations**: As the story progresses, it could expand to include international settings, showing the global impact of the VR technology and providing a diverse range of cultural and societal reactions to it.

These locations offer a variety of backdrops that can enrich the storytelling, providing visual and thematic contrast between the real and virtual worlds, and between different aspects of society and technology.Okay Nice I quite like throwing something unexpected into the mix assume all the above locations feature in the story. What could be used to make all the above not your stock cyberpunk-esque rain and neon night time city trope?

---

* Not sure what happened but I am sure there must have been something from me at this point... not sure where it went *

---

### ChatGPT:

To avoid the standard cyberpunk trope of a rain-soaked, neon-lit nighttime city, you can infuse the story with elements that offer a fresh take on the future and virtual reality. Here are some ideas:

1. **Bright and Sustainable Urban Environments**: Instead of the dark, dystopian cityscapes typical of cyberpunk, envision a future where urban areas are designed with sustainability in mind. Think green buildings, rooftop gardens, and abundant natural light. The city could have a more organic feel, with technology seamlessly integrated into nature.
    
2. **Diversity in Virtual Realms**: The VR worlds can vary drastically from the typical cyberpunk aesthetic. They could include serene natural landscapes, historical settings, abstract artistic realms, and even environments based on different cultures' mythologies and art. This variety would showcase the limitless potential of VR.
    
3. **Daytime City Life**: Shift the focus to daytime scenes in the city, highlighting daily life and routines. This could include bustling markets, public parks filled with people, and lively street scenes, contrasting with the typical night-time, underground cyberpunk settings.
    
4. **Cultural Melting Pot**: Show the city as a melting pot of various cultures and lifestyles, far from the usual gritty, homogenized cyberpunk cities. Cultural festivals, diverse cuisine, and a range of architectural styles can add color and vibrancy to the setting.
    
5. **Advanced, Clean Technology**: Instead of the grimy, industrial tech often seen in cyberpunk stories, feature clean and sleek technology. Public spaces could have interactive digital installations, and personal tech could be unobtrusively integrated into clothing and accessories.
    
6. **Utopian Elements**: While cyberpunk often leans towards dystopian themes, incorporate some utopian elements. This could include a well-functioning society with advanced healthcare, education, and a high quality of life, offering a more optimistic view of the future.
    
7. **Focus on Public and Community Spaces**: Instead of isolated, individual experiences in VR, highlight communal and shared VR experiences. Parks and community centers could offer VR experiences designed for group participation, emphasizing community and connection.
    
8. **Incorporate Historical and Traditional Elements**: Blend the future with the past by incorporating historical and traditional elements into both the real and virtual worlds. This could include architectural styles, traditional festivals, and art forms preserved or reimagined in the future setting.

By incorporating these elements, the story can offer a refreshing and optimistic vision of the future, both in the real world and within the limitless realms of virtual reality.

### Tim

Okay I like that, I am thinking Brazil or somewhere in South America. I also have a particular podcast coming to mind. Where Ai are introduced in ways to aid mother nature, where things are trained to grow in ways to provide housing, where there was a shift in how technology was used and with the high biodiversity of the rainforests and the ideal growing climate and large amount of biomass. The rainforests became the sprawling metropolis' Not concrete, steel and neon. But wood archologies, bioluminescent vines that grow into writing, The wildlife is all integrated communication between anything that has a form of communication is possible leading to strange interspecies dialects. Can you expand upon this please? More elements such as the above. Provide examples of your previous post based upon it. Give me more potential dialects through combination of the more communicative animals and and the human langages of the region. If I don't have something to take my mind off it everyone will be speaking Spa-nky (spanish-monkey) which although I find highly amusing I don't think it would exactly fit. Can you provide as many examples of this symbiosis as possible?

### ChatGPT:

Expanding upon the unique setting of a futuristic, eco-integrated South American metropolis, let's explore more elements that would enrich this world:

### Tim:

I love all of the above. Especially the languages, That the language spoken in this place is broken mix of Portuguese, Spanish, Parrot, Monkey and Even a little English, I am tempted to suggest it just be known as Squawk. I think that the there would be a perpetual twilight with a mix of dappled sunlight and bioluminescent near ground level and the city would mostly be not towering skyscrapers but it's sprawled outwards not upward. There would be archologies which would still be many many stories high but they would take the shape of Aztec pyramids. These archologies would be the "industrial" complexes. They would take on the nature of ant colonies however. And there would a continual chittering and chirping as the insects would speak in a machine code language. At ground level where it was darker and damper where the amphibian musicians prefer to be cafes, bars and clubs would be alive with music.. Amphibians with homes grown into shape that would amplify their songs a mix of latino and electro played in the keys of frog and baselines of toad. and the floors of these amplified homes would be standing water that caught the light and with the oscillations of the music provides light shows of frequency reactive wave patterns.

### ChatGPT

Your vision for this unique and vibrant metropolis, combining natural and technological elements with a rich cultural tapestry, is truly fascinating. Here's an expanded view of this world:

- **Education and Conservation**: The city places a high emphasis on education, particularly in areas of environmental conservation and bio-technology. Children grow up learning about the importance of biodiversity and the role technology can play in preserving it.

This envisioned city stands as a beacon of harmonious coexistence, where technology serves to enhance and celebrate the natural world, rather than dominate it. The blend of cultures, species, and technologies creates a society that is as sustainable as it is imaginative.

Any thoughts on the canopy layer? In terms of transport I like your suggestion about the water ways being a transport infrastructure… I also like the idea that the city is mostly pedestrian. That trees would stretch out branches in such a way that a lattice would form over time and then eventualls a solid would walk way and the springy trampoline like walkways would be solid unmoving walkways.. Also with each post on this could you have Dall-e generate an image to represent something in either my post or your reply?

#### Canopy Layer:

- **Elevated Gardens and Walkways**: The canopy layer features a network of elevated gardens and walkways, formed by interlocking branches of towering trees. This level offers a different perspective on the city, with lush greenery and hanging gardens.
- **Canopy Homes and Shops**: Integrated into the canopy are homes, shops, and cafes, built into and around the trees, offering residents and visitors a unique treetop experience.
- **Wildlife Observation Platforms**: Platforms and lookout points are scattered throughout the canopy for observing the diverse wildlife, like birds and arboreal animals, in their natural habitat.

#### Transportation:

- **Waterways**: The city’s rivers and streams serve as natural transportation channels. Boats, both manual and automated, are the primary means of long-distance travel within the city.
- **Pedestrian-Focused Design**: The city is designed to be primarily pedestrian-friendly, with walking paths and bridges connecting different areas. The ground level features winding paths that meander through the urban jungle, while the canopy level offers aerial routes across the city.
- **Living Bridges**: Bridges formed from living trees and plants connect various parts of the city. These bridges are sturdy yet organic, blending seamlessly with the surrounding environment.
- **Trampoline Walkways**: In some areas, the interwoven branches form springy, trampoline-like walkways, adding an element of playfulness to the urban landscape.

This city represents a harmonious blend of nature and urban living, where the infrastructure itself is a living, breathing part of the ecosystem. The transportation system is integrated into this ethos, prioritizing sustainable and enjoyable methods of moving through the city.
